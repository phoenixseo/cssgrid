Drupal Views Style Plugin: CSS Grid with Settings for Total (container) width, Column Count, Column Gap and Column Width

This is a Custom Drupal Module that adds a Views Style Plugin for CSS Grid. Reverse-Engineered from Drupal 10's internal new Grid Module.

Shows Input Fields for

  * Container Width (Total width of Grid-Space)
  * Column Count
  * Column Gap
  * Column Width
  * Some Kind of "Console" that calculates the ideal Column Width, which can be put into "Column Width"
  
  It's my first Drupal Module that is really used in a customer's Website. It works, but it may not be 100% Drupal best practice.
  
  I'd love to have the Inputs correspond to each other und live-update the values, but I don't know how to do that. So I defined a textarea where I write the values and formulas and the result to.
  
  Perhaps some experienced Drupal Programmer can take this to the next level. Co-Maintainer wanted. I'd love to see this little Module on Drupal.org/projects some day.
  
  This module is exactly what you need if you want to display something in a CSS Grid that fits perfectly in its "space" (max. Container width) and breaks nicely to the next responve Breakpoints.
